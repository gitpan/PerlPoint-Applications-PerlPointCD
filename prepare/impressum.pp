\BU<Credits (in alphabetical order):>

Thanks to Jürgen Christoffel for lots of ideas and for challenging us to provide CSS
support. Jürgen finally even provided the first completely CSS based layout himself.

Thanks to Lorenz Domke for his work in the PerlPoint project, for \C<pp2html> and last minute
patches to support and enable the newest features in time.
