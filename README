This archive contains PerlPointCD, a tool to compile conference CDs.

Similarly, it can be used to build websites that present the talks
of a conference.

the German Perl Workshop CDs 2002 and 2003.

INSTALLATION
------------

PerlPointCD is based on PerlPoint, an Open Source software to build
documentations and presentations on base of ASCII sources, which is
available both on CPAN and SourceForge:

 * CPAN: PerlPoint::Applications::PerlPointCD
 * SourceForge: www.sourceforge.net/projects/perlpoint

So to use PerlPointCD, PerlPoint needs to be installed. Please get
the packages

  * PerlPoint::Package (0.39 or above),
  * PerlPoint::Converters (1.01 or above),
  * Pod::PerlPoint

and install them by the usual steps

  gtar zxvf <package>.tgz
  cd <package>
  make test install distclean

Users of CPAN and CPANPLUS might simplify this process by installing
Bundle::PerlPoint and Pod::PerlPoint.

Note: PerlPoint::Converters 1.01 does not support the new features
      of PerlPoint::Package 0.39 used by PerlPointCD 3.00, so
      PerlPointCD 3.00 comes with a patched version of pp2html,
      which is used transparently.



DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The manual is provided as a "demo CD". Please open a browser and start
with build/index.html.

--------

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.
