Each Perl \X<module> marked by a
\XO<\\CPAN_MODULE>\C<\OREF{n="PerlPoint macros ready to use"}<CPAN_MODULE>> macro is not only
made a link to its site on
\XO<search.cpan.org>\URL{a="http://search.cpan.org"}<search.cpan.org>, but also integrated
into an automatically written \XO<module index>\OREF{n=Modules}<module index>. In this
\X<index>, each module has a page with links to all talks were it was mentioned via
