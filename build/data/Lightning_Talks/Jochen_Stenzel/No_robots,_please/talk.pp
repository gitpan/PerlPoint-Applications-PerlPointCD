The CD shall be available via \X<Web> as well, but you do not like to make it part of search
\X<robot> index files? Just set the \RED<\CX<-norobots>> option for your \X<PerlPoint> layouts.
In this demo distribution, this is done in \C<\X<prepare>/\X<demo-cd-base.cfg>> (one setting
for all layouts).
