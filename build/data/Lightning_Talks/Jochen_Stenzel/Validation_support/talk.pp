\XO<validation>Generated pages
prior the final \CX<make> call for \OREF{n="The master CD"}<CD mastering>
contain links to validate a page by public services. There are links for \X<HTML validation>,
\X<CSS validation> and \X<link checks>.

\TS\I<Please note that due to the principles of site checking used by these services, validation
links only work if the CD is placed on a webserver.>

In the final \C<make> call (with target \C<cd>), these validation links are suppressed.
