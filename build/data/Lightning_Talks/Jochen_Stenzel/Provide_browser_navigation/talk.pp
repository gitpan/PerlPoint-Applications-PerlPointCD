Did you know that \XO<browser navigation bar>browsers can display a \X<navigation> \X<bar> of
their own, controlled by the \X<HTML> page? I did not, till Jürgen Christoffel told me.
In fact this feature is that modern that currently only (recent versions of) \X<Mozilla>
and \X<Opera> seem to support it.

||c||  Mozilla calls this "Site Navigation Bar"
  (View / Show/Hide / Site Navigation Bar / ...).

  In Opera, activate the "Navigation Bar"
  (View / Navigation Bar / ...).

The demo makes use of this feature, so you should see a working bar in these browsers.

If you like to make your CD offer those bars, just use the \RED<\CX<-linknavigation>> option
for your \X<PerlPoint> \X<layout>s. In this demo distribution, this is done in
\C<\X<prepare>/\X<demo-cd-base.cfg>> (one setting for all layouts).
