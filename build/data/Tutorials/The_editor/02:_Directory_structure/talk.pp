Now, after having installed the stuff, I can look around. The tool is \I<directory based>,
which makes it easy and handy to modify things as one needs.

At first level there is a \CX<PerlPointCD> directory with utilities and configurations
used by the tool itself. I do not need to switch anything in there unless I want to modify
the way things basically work.

The second directory is \CX<prepare>, which holds files to be used in the CD process such
as \X<layouts>, \X<configurations> and sources for \X<preambles> and \X<impressum> and the like.
I will edit most of them as they are an essential basis of the CD contents. They are not going
to the CD directly.

That's different with the contents of the third subdirectory, \CX<build>. This is where the
talk materials are collected and the CD contents will be made. Everything the authors provide
for the CD goes into there - into its \CX<data> subdirectory. This is the centre court, and
there is more to say about it. So come to my next talk as well ;-)
