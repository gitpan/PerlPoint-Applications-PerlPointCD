How to get this package and make it run? Well, installing PerlPointCD is as simple as the
installation of any CPAN package:

* Install the prerequisites: \CPAN_MODULE<PerlPoint::Package>,
  \CPAN_MODULE<PerlPoint::Converters> and \CPAN_MODULE<Pod::PerlPoint>.
  Alternatively, users of \CPAN_MODULE<CPAN> and \CPAN_MODULE<CPANPLUS> might find
  \C<Bundle::PerlPoint> helpful to get them all at once.

* Get the PerlPointCD \X<package>. It is stored on \X<CPAN>
  (\CPAN_MODULE<PerlPoint::Applications::PerlPointCD>)
  and \X<SourceForge> (see \URLT<www.sourceforge.net/projects/perlpoint>).

* Unpack the package:

||c||  gtar zxvf PerlPoint-Applications-PerlPointCD-<version>.tgz

This makes a new directory PerlPoint-Applications-PerlPointCD-<version>. I can switch therein
and start the CD project! This is my working directory.

After this initial step, I have a look at the \X<directory structure>.
