Basically, the conference CD shall supply \X<materials> of the conference talks: presented and
bonus \X<slides>, \X<annotations>, \X<articles>, \X<scripts>, \X<examples>, \X<applications> and
the like - just what the speakers want to provide. To \X<collect> and \X<arrange> all these
materials can be a titanic task for a CD team of volunteers. But why not arrange the duties?

A usual model of talk preparation is to have \X<custodians> for the speakers. They are
discussing the talk, \X<review>ing intermediate versions of articles and taking care of
\X<deadlines>. When time goes by they typically know what a talk is about, so \I<they> can
prepare the CD parts of their fosterlings. And this is not difficult.

To do so, they just need to install PerlPointCD as well - and ask the speakers for their
materials. (Well, \I<this> might become a challenge ;-)
