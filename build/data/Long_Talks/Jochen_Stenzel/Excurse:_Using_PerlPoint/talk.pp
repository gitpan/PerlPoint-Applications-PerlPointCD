In the previous articles, \X<PerlPoint> was mentioned as the format of choice to write
abstracts and bios. But how to write PerlPoint?

In short, PerlPoint is like Perl: it is easy to start with and to do simple tasks, but possible
to do really complex tasks as well, after passing a learning curve. But again, even this isn't
really difficult. PerlPoint was designed to be intuitive.

To introduce the basics, and to demonstrate how speaker provided stuff besides abstract and bio
is intergrated into the CD, I add an HTML version of the PerlPoint intro that comes with
\CPAN_MODULE<PerlPoint::Package>.
