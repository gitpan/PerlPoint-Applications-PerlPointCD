  We counted our coffee material needs over half a year.
  Surprisingly, we consume almost as much milk as coffee!
  We need

  # 50% coffee

  # 40% milk

  # 10% sugar</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></UL></UL>


<P>
The first paragraph is another headline, opening a new chapter. The next paragraph is of a new type - this is a <I>text</I> paragraph. For convenience, it needs no special startup character. So you can start writing text without thinking of rules. The paragraph ends with an empty line as usual.
</P>


<P>
The following list consists of paragraphs starting with a <CODE>#</CODE>. What's that? The <CODE>#</CODE> symbolizes a number, and these paragraphs are made points of an <I>ordered list</I>. They will be replaced by the correct numbers automatically. Store the source, rerun <CODE>pp2html</CODE> and look at the results!

The new chapter is made a new slide, and the ordered list contains numbers.
