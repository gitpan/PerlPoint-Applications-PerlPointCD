OK, well done! You are now familiar with the base process of PerlPoint working. But there are several more things to discover, including tags, image inclusion, source nesting and on the fly source generation. And there are several more formats to convert sources into, currently including LaTeX, SDF, POD and Clinton Pierce's Perl Projector. Further processing (by additional utilities) provides formatted text, manual pages, PostScript, PDF and more. Read on in the tutorial which will explain these features in detail.
