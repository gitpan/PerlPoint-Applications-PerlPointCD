<P>
OK, well - we are almost done with our first sheet. We are only missing a headline. &quot;Enjoy office coffee&quot; might be chosen. We add it to the points.

  =Enjoy office coffee

  * Come when you are thirsty.

  * Make new coffee if the pot is empty.

  * Fill your cup (regardless of size).

  * Insert 0,50 into the box.</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE></UL></UL>


<P>
Note that the headline looks very similar to the points - it's a paragraph as well. The <I>startup character</I> makes the difference - each paragraph type has its own. Headlines begin with a <CODE>=</CODE>.
