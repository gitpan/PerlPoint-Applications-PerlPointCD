We have the talk \X<materials>, \X<welcome text> and \X<impressum>, we have \X<layout>s and
a \X<startup page>, and of course a passed \X<deadline>, so ... the CD is ready! Now we can
go for a master CD.

The way to do this is almost the same as for every intermediate version. Just add an additional
target \CX<cd> to the call of \CX<make>:

||c||  make \RED<cd>

Additionally to the usual steps of making HTML pages, \X<directories> are
\OREF{n="Tree implosion"}<renamed> to a \X<DOS>, \X<ISO> and web address compliant scheme,
and the pages are generated without \X<validation links>.

As usual, the results can be found in the \CX<build> directory. \I<To burn the CD, just burn the
contents of this directory (make it the CD root dir).>
